**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: November 22, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Decided to start my portfolio website, sketched out what I wanted generally, decided to use bootstrap so I can get more practice with it. Worked on Navbar. Decided I want different colors for my text and changed via specific tags but think it might be easier to change bootstrap itself with sass. Briefly read about how to do that. Hopefully going to do that tomorrow. 

**Thoughts**: I definitely forgot things I've learned like how to start an html document(!) but quickly figured it out. Having the internet at my fingertips is very benefical. Realizing I won't know everything all the time helps me remember why I love coding I get to always learn. I learned how to fork today! Using bootstrap in practice instead of just theory is a great way to learn. There was some stress trying to remember things and get back in the groove but overall good. I did accidentally create a folder in a folder again but quickly fixed it.
