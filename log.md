### Day 1: November 22, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Decided to start my portfolio website, sketched out what I wanted generally, decided to use bootstrap so I can get more practice with it. Worked on Navbar. Decided I want different colors for my text and changed via specific tags but think it might be easier to change bootstrap itself with sass. Briefly read about how to do that. Hopefully going to do that tomorrow. 

**Thoughts**: I definitely forgot things I've learned like how to start an html document(!) but quickly figured it out. Having the internet at my fingertips is very benefical. Realizing I won't know everything all the time helps me remember why I love coding I get to always learn. I learned how to fork today! Using bootstrap in practice instead of just theory is a great way to learn. There was some stress trying to remember things and get back in the groove but overall good. I did accidentally create a folder in a folder again but quickly fixed it.

### Day 2: Nov 23, 2021

**Today's Progress**:My lnks disappeared!!! I spent three hours debugging it and had help figure out that I accidentally added the class nav-link to my ad blocker in chrome. I originally thought it was an issue with bootstrap but after doing a test w/out bootstrap I figured it was probably the inspector. Also found out it worked fine in firefox. Ben actually helped determine I accidentally added it to the ad blocker which was easy to do when right clicking to inspector b/c the block element was right above that. We were able to take that option away from my menu so it won't happen again. 
**Thoughts**: I was a little frustrated b/c it wasn't working but actually liked figuring out what was wrong. It's been awhile since I had to debug something so its refreshing that I didn't give up and wasn't too annoyed.

### Day 3: Nov 24, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Picked a color scheme! finsihed the navbar, started the about section. realized my picture wasn't working b/c of the photo itself and quickly fixed that. 
**Thoughts**: Bootstrap made completing the navbar super fast and easy! I really like my color scheme and hope it will ultimatly will work.

### Day 4: Nov 25, 2021

**Today's Progress**: added screengrabs on my work to page. added title and description and worked on a popup but then decided I don't want a popup so have to rethink my design.
**Thoughts**: Deciding on a design as I go is interesting. It helps my creative juices flow. Since this is a personal project I don't mind it but if it was professional those details would def need to be decided beforehand.

### Day 5: Nov 26, 2021

**Today's Progress**: worked with color palate a little. made portfolio "cards", made responsive
**Thoughts**: bootstrap makes it so easy to make the site responsive and spacing what I want. I am pleasantly surprised.

### Day 6: Dec 1, 2021

**Today's Progress**:added links to my pages. discovered my bootstrap is not centered!
**Thoughts**: working while sick is exhausting. I made a plan to do the simple links which is good to have a plan.

### Day 7: Dec 3, 2021

**Today's Progress**:added social media logos/links, added a box for about, attempted to center page
**Thoughts**: I feel like I could center this page if I was just using css but I'm trying to do it via bootstrap so it's going to take longer. I'm also wondering if I can change my social media links to my color scheme? they are currently white.

### Day 8: Dec 6, 2021

**Today's Progress**:Looked up jobs in my area! Started to prepare for "mock" interview tomorrow. 
**Thoughts**: I'm so nervous for my mock interview. It's only for practice but my nerves are REAL! I'm also once again overwhelmed looking at the requirements for jobs. I have to remember I do have skills and it won't hurt to apply to places regardless of the requirements.

### Day 9: Dec 7, 2021

**Today's Progress**:did my mock interview and applied for a job.
**Thoughts**: I learned that I need more confidence b/c I do know what I'm talking about. It was also great to get feedback on what I can improve. I'll be making an outline to try to make my 'elevator pitch' more clear.
