### Day 1: November 22, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Decided to start my portfolio website, sketched out what I wanted generally, decided to use bootstrap so I can get more practice with it. Worked on Navbar. Decided I want different colors for my text and changed via specific tags but think it might be easier to change bootstrap itself with sass. Briefly read about how to do that. Hopefully going to do that tomorrow. 

**Thoughts**: I definitely forgot things I've learned like how to start an html document(!) but quickly figured it out. Having the internet at my fingertips is very benefical. Realizing I won't know everything all the time helps me remember why I love coding I get to always learn. I learned how to fork today! Using bootstrap in practice instead of just theory is a great way to learn. There was some stress trying to remember things and get back in the groove but overall good. I did accidentally create a folder in a folder again but quickly fixed it.

### Day 2: Nov 23, 2021

**Today's Progress**:My lnks disappeared!!! I spent three hours debugging it and had help figure out that I accidentally added the class nav-link to my ad blocker in chrome. I originally thought it was an issue with bootstrap but after doing a test w/out bootstrap I figured it was probably the inspector. Also found out it worked fine in firefox. Ben actually helped determine I accidentally added it to the ad blocker which was easy to do when right clicking to inspector b/c the block element was right above that. We were able to take that option away from my menu so it won't happen again. 
**Thoughts**: I was a little frustrated b/c it wasn't working but actually liked figuring out what was wrong. It's been awhile since I had to debug something so its refreshing that I didn't give up and wasn't too annoyed.

### Day 2: Nov 24, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Picked a color scheme! finsihed the navbar, started the about section. realized my picture wasn't working b/c of the photo itself and quickly fixed that. 
**Thoughts**: Bootstrap made completing the navbar super fast and easy! I really like my color scheme and hope it will ultimatly will work.
